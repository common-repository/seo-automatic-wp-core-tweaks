Requires at least: 3.8
Tested up to: 5.8.1
Stable tag: 4.1.1

Primarily for use in <b>new WP installations</b>, the steps are based on an employee checklist from Search Commander, Inc. for setting up sites.

== Description ==
Even before you add an SEO plugin, the steps after a WP installation can take 20 to 40 minutes. This plugin eliminates that time, putting all the options on one admin screen. This plugin does not replace other SEO plugins. It does what they don’t do; Properly prepare you for their installation.

You should have no other plugins active while running this setup plugin, since it is primarily for new installations.

This plugin extends the built-in features of WordPress, and has an import / export feature, saving you even more time for additional installations.

All of the “little things”, from deleting the Hello World post to changing the permalink structure are all accessible from a single admin page.

This plug-in is designed to be a COMPANION to other plugins like All in one SEO or Yoast SEO and is not intended as a replacement for those. In fact, as they get better and add features, we routinely disabled any of our duplicated features to avoid conflicts. 

= Features =
From one admin screen, click a button and make any or all of these changes...

1.	Change default post category name from "uncategorized" to: 
2.	Turn OFF organization of uploads into month and year-based folders.
3.	Set the RSS feed to display only a summary.
4.	Change permalink structure to custom setting: 
5.	Add a page and shortcode for the integrated DDSiteMap Generator
6.	Create a privacy page with your contact information
7.	Add a Contact Page 
8.	Delete default "Hello World" post.
9.	Select a page to be displayed as your home page
10.	Change default post comments on articles.
11.	Delete default comment
12.	Set the main blog email
13.	Set the admin user's blog email
14.	Add new users
15.	Change the default page name from "about"
16.	Set the default page as the front page.
17.	Create the page to designate for displaying your blog posts, and name it: 
18.	Change the blog description tagline. 
19.	Advanced:
20.	Uploads Folder: You will need to have writable permission
21.	Attempt to create the uploads folder and set the permission to writable.
22. Import / export your settings from another site. Once you set preferences the first time, just export. Then import that file on future domains, and you're done.

Notes: 

1. We recommend disabling any other plugins before running the process to minimize potential conflicts. We can pretty much guarantee there will be NO conflicts when you re-enable them, but if there are we'll fix them for n/c.

2. In 2013 we integrated another of our own plugins called “Our Profiles”. This feature adds a new menu item with an admin page to enter all of your social URLs so you can display them with a single shortcode on a page, post, or in a widget.

3. Your .htaccess file should be writable for your permalinks to change.

4. The permalink option is “on” by default. If you’ve already set your permalinks and forgot to uncheck the option box, you can easily go back and change back to your original settings in wp-admin > Settings > Permalinks.

== Installation ==

After activation, go to the  Core Tweaks admin page and either use the default selections, or make choices of your own. 

Designed as a new setup assistant, this plug-in is usually installed before any others. If you've added other plugins and have them actice, deactivate them first to avoid potential conflicts, then REactivate them after you run the setup process.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is this plugin for? =

This plugin saves 20 to 40 minutes of post-installation time, properly setting up a new WordPress installation. 

It adds a new Admin menu item, SEO Automatic - with a sub-menu Core Tweaks, giving access on one page to all of the things that savvy programmers change for every installation. 

It also adds a second sub-menu item called "Our Profiles". When the profiles are filled in, users can add a shortcode on any page or post to display the links to their review profiles. 

For older themes that do not support custom menus, it also combines several other WP plugins for theme customization, turned off by default in the bottom of the admin screen.


= What if I already have a Wordpress site up and running? =

Then this plugin won't save you nearly as much time unless you've done little customization after your installation. Deactivate any plugins that are turned on, and be sure to UNcheck any options in the admin panel that you may have already completed, or that you don't need to change.

= Does core tweaks work with Windows servers? =

No - Windows servers are not currently supported, and never will be.

= What if I need more help? =
Please visit the <a href='https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/seo-automatic-wp-core-tweaks'>Support Forum</a>.

= Help! I have a missing/broken image on the privacy policy page created by Core Tweaks =

This has been corrected starting with version 3.71. The previous image supplied by freeprivacypolicy.com became unavailable and we didn't notice. 

If you have not edited your privacy policy after creation, either delete it and and use core tweaks to add one again after you have upgraded to 3.71 or higher, or much easier, manually edit your page to remove the broken image.

= Import file does not set options correctly. =

You will need to manually set your options and save a new export.

== Other Notes ==

1. We recommend disabling any other plugins before running the process to minimize potential confilcts. There will be no conflicts when you re-enable them.

2. Your .htaccess file should be writable for your permalinks to change.

3. The permalink option is "on" by default. If you've already set your permalinks and forgot to uncheck the option box, you can easily go back and change back to your original settings in wp-admin > Settings > Permalinks.
